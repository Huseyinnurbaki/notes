 Simon Reindl

After a short time you and your team should reflect on what has happened, and how it affected the performance within the team. Building on the better understanding, the team should decide what they will do to enhance the good things, and remove the bad things – that is you should focus on changing the environment to be better. This means that things will be different. If the situation is not different, then you have not acted on the learning (or your team are perfect).

 In the movie Groundhog Day, the weatherman (Phil) realises that he is repeating the same day. He then goes wild and breaks all the rules, and after he gets bored and then focuses on improving. He then makes each day a little better than the previous day – until he gets the perfect day.

 Limit the number of things that you are going to change. If it is a significant or challenging thing, then only take one action. Talk about this item in each Daily Scrum.

thermostat

samples temperaure in room
comparing inspecting temperaure & goal temperature.

adjust tempetretaure According to the goal.

if inspecting value & goal are equal, it still will conntinue inspecting.

3 things for empricisim to work

you have to know what the goal is
inspect frequently enough to keep temp under control
transparency (knowing excactly whats going on) know the environment (for the thermostat example, if you are checking temperature at tea time which teapot is close to the themostat, this is something environmental you shgould know)

inspect and adapt - the goal must be cristal clear.

Escaping the Predictability Trap
Kurt Bittner


-   Instead of demanding predictable plans, focus on articulating clear goals and clearly framing experiments, including how you will evaluate them, and be open to learning new things.

-  - Managers love focusing on productivity and “efficiency” but frequently fail to consider the value that is being delivered. Delivering value is what is important, not how many “units of work” (like story points, which are themselves just guesses) were delivered. What is better: driving 100 miles per hour in the wrong direction, or one mile per hour in the right? Productivity is important, but tracking does not help to improve it. Instead, focus your efforts on removing waste and impediments, and clearly articulating goals. When walking a rough and uncertain path, it’s not how fast you go that matters but whether you reach your destination. To go faster, place smaller bets, run shorter experiments, and evaluate where you are more frequently; you’ll save time not having to backtrack later.

- The problem is that we are not very good at anticipating the future, and we really have no idea of the kinds of opportunities we may encounter along the way. It may seem a bit scary that we really don’t know where we are headed, and that luck plays a large part in what we end up doing. The reality is that we cannot really imagine what jobs will exist in ten years, or even five, nor can we conceive that many of today’s jobs will no longer exist. So how to do we prepare ourselves for what lies ahead? By cultivating flexibility, by trying new things, and by solving hard problems and acquiring whatever skills we need to do so. In the end, adaptability and ability to learn quickly are the keys to success, not steadily marching to the beat of someone else’s drum. Just as with Scrum, we succeed personally by trying new approaches and evaluating the results, in measured experiments.

- “Transformation” is a word that I often associate with the phrase “magical thinking”: organizations seem to believe that they can predictively plan how they are going to “become agile”.  This is usually based on the misconception that agile is a process, or is rather like a tool, that can be “installed” or “rolled out” to an organization. It doesn’t work that way. Agility, or the word I think better captures the essence of what we seek, adaptability, is a cultural quality, a way of thinking and acting that deeply changes the way that people see and act in the world. It is not a specific set of practices or behaviors that can be adopted. It is a way of thinking and acting that involves continually seeking better results and better outcomes. As such, specific practices will change as conditions and skills change. We cannot plan how this is going to proceed, and as different teams have different challenges, their path toward agility will be different. There is no “magical” set of practices, roles, or processes that makes this easier.

- As manufacturers learned, “lean” manufacturing involved a lot more than installing andon cords to enable the line to be stopped; it relied on the cultural values that let any employee pull the andon cord if they see something that is wrong. In pursuit of agile cultural values, organizations will find that agility may look messy on the surface, as different teams make different decisions in pursuit of their own continuous improvement toward their own goals. What is predictable is the empirical approach that defines our path: making observations, forming experiments on how we think we can improve, and continually seeking better performance.

Dave West

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. (scrum values)

common misunderstandings

These values sound easy? Well, there are many misunderstandings and common problems when applying these values. Here are some examples.

Value Misunderstanding
Getting the value right

Commitment
Committing to something that you don’t understand because you are told to by your boss. Committing yourself to the team and Sprint Goal.

Focus
Focusing on keeping the customer happy. Being focused on the Sprint and its goal.

Openness
Telling everyone everything about all your work. Highlighting when you have challenges and problems that are stopping you from success.

Respect
Thinking you are helping the team by being a hero. Helping people to learn the things that you are good at and not judging the things that others aren’t good at.

Courage
Even after the decision has been made continuing to push back. Being transparent, but willing to change even if that means accepting that you are wrong, or that your opinion is not the direction that the team is going.


Values like anything in Scrum need to be both visible and inspected and adapted on. These are five ideas from my own experience(Dave West) for encouraging the values to be transparent and considered in your Scrum Team:


Put the values on a wall and have each team member write up how they are going to demonstrate the value in their working day.

Add a ‘values moment’ to your retrospective. This gives everyone an opportunity to inspect and adapt on their values.

Introduce a ‘values’ prize. Not a serious prize, but a fun prize that sometimes can be delivered to two people or the whole team when a value has been demonstrated and everyone is aware of it.

The ‘whoops we dropped the value’ prize provides a way of demonstrating courage, but also highlighting when we missed a value. Of course, this prize could end up being a very negative thing so it should always be delivered in a fun way without negative implications.

Getting external managers or stakeholders to demonstrate to the team a value and what it means to them.
